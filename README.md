# FRA321 AI Part

Hello, AI Engineers!

In this github you will find resources to jump start your AI journey. We will cover one of the topics in AI - Searching Algorithms. Searching algorithms are used to search through a state space to find a path to the goal. You can utilize these searching algorithms to do many things such as pathplanning or even basic Game AI.

There are many parts in this github.
