# FRA321 AI Part

Hello, AI Engineers!

In this github you will find resources to jump start your AI journey. We will cover one of the topics in AI - Searching Algorithms. Searching algorithms are used to search through a state space to find a path to the goal. You can utilize these searching algorithms to do many things such as path planning or even basic Game AI.

There are many parts in this github.
1. My Contact and Office Hour
2. Lectures
3. Lab Manuals
4. Lab Code
5. Submission and Oral Test

## My Contact and Office Hour

You can contact me via my facebook: Bawornsak Sakulkueakulsuk, or shoot me an email at Bawornsak.S@gmail.com.
I will hold a class once a month, and go through all the materials. So you can choose when to attend the class. If you choose not to attend a live session, you can find all the lectures in the link below. I will hold office hours upon requested.  

## Lectures

You can find all lectures at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpJFWWZXdN_rqxl-tVdyeIqf8x9q6tQxF

Topics included:
1. Introduction to AI (13.10 - end of the clip)
2. Problem Solving - Data Structure
3. Problem Solving - Searching Algorithms
4. Uninformed Search - Breadth-first Search
5. Uninformed Search - Uniform-cost Search
6. Uninformed Search - Depth-first Search
7. Heuristic Search - Greedy Best-first Search
8. Heuristic Search - A* Search
9. Other Algorithms - Searching with No Observation (only on-site)
10. Other Algorithms - Searching with Partial Observation (only on-site)
11. Other Algorithms - Genetic Algorithms (only on-site)
12. Other Algorithms - Game AI


## Lab Manuals

Lab Mannuals are homework for this part. You need to study the materials and complete the lab by hand and by code. If you don't know what you're doing, or if you have questions, any questions, you can find me as mentioned above. 

There are 2 lab manuals: Uninformed Search Lab, and Heuristic Search Lab. You will find many questions and coding challenges in both manuals. Treat these as a guiding question for your study. These are the sort of questions asked in the oral exam.


## Code

For coding homework, you will modify the codes provided in Uninformed Search folder. There are 3 files in the folders.
1. Agent.py - this class provides basic functionalities of AI Agent.
2. Sim.py - this is the main class. Run this file to simulate the searching algorithm. Modify this file to change the searching algorithms
3. World.py - this class provides world building code.

Basically, you just need to modify Sim.py for algorithms you want to implement. But feel free to modify other parts also.


## Submission and Exam

You do not need to submit anything. However, you need to demonstrate your knowledge in the exam, which will be held once a month at the end of each month. You can take the exam multiple times. Only the highest scores will be counted. More info to come . . .
