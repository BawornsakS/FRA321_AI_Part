class Node:

    """A node in a search tree. Contains a pointer to the parent (the node
    that this is a successor of) and to the actual state for this node. Note
    that if a state is arrived at by two paths, then there are two nodes with
    the same state.  Also includes the action that got us to this state, and
    the total path_cost (also known as g) to reach the node.  Other functions
    may add an f and h value; see best_first_graph_search and astar_search for
    an explanation of how the f and h values are handled. You will not need to
    subclass this class."""
